## EXPERIENCE
### [Shopee(E-Commerce)](https://shopee.sg) 　 Singapore　Android Engineer 　Jun 2022 ~ Present
* Cold startup time optimization:
    * Decreased p80 cold startup time of Shopee which has more than 20 million DAUs (the biggest e-commerce in Southeast Asia) from **7.6s to 4.5s** by executing startup tasks in parallel, multi-level image cache and image preloading.
     * Decreased **8%** of p80 cold startup time by introducing [Baseline Profiles](https://developer.android.com/topic/performance/baselineprofiles/overview) to Shopee , which involved upgrading of many gradle plugins. In the meantime, we could generate Baseline Profile automatically regardless of different ABtest values.
   * Other optimazations: Increasing Main and Render Thread priority, Dex2Oat, prefetching and preloading.
* App fluency opmization:
  * Improved block rate by **14%** by loading images asynchronously with Glide and Kotlin coroutines optimization.
  * Improved block rate by **5%** by imageview placeholder optimazation.
<!-- * Implemented many bussiness features, such as bottom bar ainimation and popup windows -->

### [KuaiShou(Short Video)](https://www.kuaishou.com/) 　 Beijing　Android Engineer 　Dec 2018 ~ Jun 2022
* ANR optimization:
  * Decreased ANR rate of Kwai which has more than 40 million DAUs (the biggest competitor of TikTok in Brazil) from **1.2%** to **0.7%** by resolving Broadcast/Service/Input timeout issues.

* Cold startup time optimization:
    * Decreased p50 cold startup time of KuaiShou which has more than 300 million DAUs (second biggest short video company in China) by **28%** (from **5.6s to 4.0s**), fixed time-cost issuses and monitored deterioration in the laboratory. 
* Others:
    * Customized [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/) engine builds. The size of Flutter engine for android decreased **85.7%** from **3.5M to 0.5M**(dynamic loading libapp.so). A [PR](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/pull/43312) was accepted by Flutter team.
