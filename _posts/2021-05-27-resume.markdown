* [Hotfix Patch Robust](https://github.com/Meituan-Dianping/Robust)   The sponsor of this project, using AOP technology (Javassist mainly, supplemented by ASM) to insert a code snippet which is a if-statement before first line of every method  in the app to the hook method flows, and automaticly generating patches (the code that fixes the bug is translated into the code which the online app can run automaticly). The project involves a lot of bytecode operations.The difficulty of the project is that the official released APK is processed by ProGuard,and the patch needs to be obfuscated according to the same ProGuard rules.The project had been [opened on GitHub](https://github.com/Meituan-Dianping/Robust), getting more than 4k stars. At the same time, two articles were posted on the Meituan Technology Blog：[Android hot patch](https://tech.meituan.com/android_robust.html) and [Android hot patch solution Robust open source,add automated patch tools](https://tech.meituan.com/android_autopatch.html)
